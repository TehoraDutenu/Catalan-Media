				Catalans Dragons provide open training sessions where fans can get to meet the players.<br>
				If you're in town a couple of days before the match you could go along, check with the club website <a href="http://www.catalansdragons.com">www.catalansdragons.com</a> for times and dates.

			</p>

			<h4>Food & Drink</h4>
			<p>
				There are many bars and food outlets within the stadium, and the good news is, that although the old plastic token system still exists, most bars and food outlets in the Brutus take card payments.
				<br>
				There is Guinness and fish and chips available as well as beer, wine, burgers, hotdogs, chips and churros (sweet donut fingers). 
				<br>
				There is a club shop selling souvenirs and replica kit beneath the Puig Aubert (away) stand.
