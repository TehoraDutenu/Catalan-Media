		Perpignan is packed with great cafes and restaurants with every taste catered for in a wide variety of styles and price brackets.
		<br><br>
		You can expect to be paying 20-25 Euros for Entrecote (rump) steak and frites (chips) and, don't forget, the French like their meat rare so it's usually best to order a little more well done than back home.
		<br><br>
		Salads (salades) and fish (poisson) dishes are amazing in the city but if you want a true taste of the region, go for the Cassoulet. It's a hot stew of beans, sausages, pork and sometimes duck which might not sound too appetising on a hot day in the sun but, once tried, never forgotten. Truly delicious and a source of pride to individual chefs. Very filling, order a starter (entrée) portion unless you're very hungry.
		<br><br>
		Finish up with a Crème Catalane or Iles Flottantes (meringues in custard) for a true taste of local cuisine.

    <h5>Drinking...</h5>

    <p>
		A day at the rugby in Perpignan wouldn't be the same without a cold beer or glass of the local plonk.
		<br><br>
		Most fans gather at Le Castillet for a pre-match singalong and there are bars there that cater especially for the rugby crowd, with outdoor beer and wine taps.
		<br><br>
		There are often queues to the bar and especially to the toilets at the back of the bars, so if you don't like waiting why not try other parts of town.
		<br><br>Pelforth, Kronenbourg and Estrella are popular brands of beer and you can pay between three and five euros for a pint of draught (biere pression grande) depending where you stop.
		<br><br>
		Of course, being France, wines are available everywhere. Order a glass (verre), bottle (bouteille) or half-litre (demi pichet) of the local red (rouge), white (blanc) or rose and you'll be surprised at the fine quality of vin being produced in the Languedoc Roussillon region these days.
